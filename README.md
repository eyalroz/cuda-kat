# cuda-kat: CUDA Kernel Author's Tools

An install-less, header-only library which is a loosely-coupled collection of **utility functions and classes** for writing **device-side CUDA code** (kernels and non-kernel functions). These let us:

* Write templated device-side without constantly coming up against not-trivially-templatable bits.
* Use standard-library(-like) containers in device-side code (but not _have_ to use them).
* Not repeat ourselves as much (the [DRY principle](https://wiki.c2.com/?DontRepeatYourself)).
* Use less magic numbers.
* Make our device-side code less cryptic and idiosyncratic, with clearer naming and semantics.

... while not committing to any particular framework, paradigm or class hierarchy - and not compromising performance.

## <a name="what-is-in-the-box">The tools in the box</a>

The library has Doxygen documentation, available [here](https://codedocs.xyz/eyalroz/cuda-kat/). However - it is far from being complete. 

An alternative place to start is the table below. Since `cuda-kat`'s different facilities mostly correspond to different files (and not many such files), the table 
The various utility functions (and occasional other constructs) available in the `cuda-kat` package are accessed through the files in the following table. Each of these may be used independently of the others (although internally there are some dependencies); and no file imposes any particular abstraction or constraint on the rest of your code.

For further details you can either explore the files themselves or read the Doxygen-genereated [official documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/eyalroz/cuda-kat/). Note The toolbox is not complete (especially the bottom items in the listing above), so expect some additions of files, and within files.


## <a name="the-patterns-that-repeat">Motivating example: The patterns that repeat! </a>

To illustrate the motivation for `cuda-kat` and the spirit in which it's written, let's focus on one kind of functionality: Referring to information about blocks, threads, warps, lanes and grids.

### <a name="an-obvious-example">You know you've written this before...</a>

As you write more CUDA kernels - for an application or a library - you likely begin to notice yourself repeating many small patterns of code. A popular one would be  computing the global id of a thread in a linear grid:
```
auto global_thread_id = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
```
we've all been using that again and again, right? Many of us find ourselves writing a small utility function for this pattern. Perhaps it's something like:
```
auto global_thread_id() { return threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x; }
```
In fact, some of those end up having written this same function several times, in several projects we've worked on. This is irksome, especially when you know that about every other CUDA library probably has this function, or uses this pattern, somewhere in its bowels. thrust does. cub does. cudf does. (moderngpu, weirdly, doesn't) and so on.

But here's the rub: When you do implement these convenience/utility functions, they're a part of something larger, which comes with its own assumptions, and dependencies, and abstractions. If you could only just share such small, low-level pieces of code among multiple projects without there being any "strings attached"...

Well, this is what `cuda-kat` is for.

### <a name="making-your-kernel-code-more-natural-language-like"> Say it with natural-language-like mnemonics</a>

The example of `global_thread_id()` is quite obvious in that it involves multiple operations and writing the function name is more terse than spelling out the computation. But naming this pattern is attractive just as much due to our giving of a **meaningful name** to the computation, regardless of its length. It's also an application of the  [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself); and it removes numerous repetitive calculations, which divert attention from the more meaningful computational work you're actually carrying out in your kernel.

But let's make that more concrete. Consider the following statements:
```
if (threadIdx.x == blockDim.x - 1) { do_stuff(); }
auto foo = threadIdx.x % warpSize;
auto bar = blockDim.x / warpSize;
```
when you write them, what you _really_ mean to be saying is:
```
if (this_thread_is_the_last_in_its_block()) { do_stuff(); }
auto foo = lane_id_within_warp();
auto bar = num_full_warps_in_grid_block();
```
and these, while longer to type, are clearer to the reader and less prone to typos.

### <a name="putting-things-in-order">... and put them all in order.</a>

Instead of a flat collection of rather long-named functions:
```
global_thread_id()
lane_id_within_warp()
this_thread_is_the_last_in_its_block()
num_full_warps_in_grid_block()
```
the library groups these (and many other related) functions into relevant namespaces. We thus have:
```
linear_grid::thread::global_id()
lane::id()
linear_grid::thread::is_last_in_block()
linear_grid::block::num_full_warps()
```
which is easier to browse through if you use auto-complete. The order comes at the expense of brevity... but we can alleviate this somewhat with a shorter namespace. The above can then become simply:
```
namespace gi = kat::linear_grid;
gi::thread::global_id()
gi::lane::id()
gi::thread::is_last_in_block()
gi::block::num_full_warps()
```
in your code. Now _this_ is how I want to write my kernels!

You will note, that most similar phrases you could come up with about positions and sizes within the grid - already have implementations. For example: "I can get the number of full warps, but now I want the number of warps, period"; well, just replace `num_full_warps()` with `num_warps()` and it's there: `linear_grid::block::num_warps()` is available.

And as a final bonus - if you write a non-linear kernel, with blocks and grids having y and z dimensions other than 1 - you will only need to change your `namespace =` or `using` statements, to be able to write the same code and use 3-D implementations of these functions instead.
