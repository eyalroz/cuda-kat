 *
 * @note Theoretically, the @param serialization_factor value could be
 * computed by this function itself. This is avoided, assuming that's
 * been take care of before. Specifically, we assume that the
 * @param serialization_factor is no higher than it absolutely
 * must be.
 *
 * @note There's a block-level variant of this primitive, but there -
 * each block applies f to the _same_ range of elements, rather than
 * covering part of a larger range.
 *
 * @note This implementation does not handle cases of overflow of
 * the @tparam Size type, e.g. if your Size is uint32_t and @param
 * length is close to 2^32 - 1, the function may fail.
 *
 * @note There's a tricky tradeoff here between avoiding per-iteration
 * checks for whether we're past the end, and avoiding too many
 * initial checks. Two of the the template parameters help up avoid
 * this tradeoff in certain cases by not having to check explicitly
 * for things.
 *
 *
 * @param length The length of the range (of integers) on which to act
 * @param serialization_factor the number of elements each thread is to
 * handle (serially)
 * @param f The callable to execute for each element of the sequence.
